# Statistical Balance in Pro Basketball ‚Äì NBA vs. WNBA

This project explores whether WNBA teams demonstrate greater statistical balance than NBA teams, and how that balance may influence scoring output and team performance.

### üß† Key Components:
- **Linear Weights Model** to evaluate the contribution of individual stats (e.g., FG, 3P, FT, AST, TOV) to team scoring
- **Regression Analysis** to identify feature importance and correlation with points per game
- **Team of Clones Method** to simulate team efficiency with evenly distributed performance

### üí° Why It Matters:
This analysis highlights how different leagues structure offensive production and offers insight into the value of statistical balance in team dynamics‚Äîapplicable in both sports and broader team-based environments. Specifically, this project focuses on emphasis on star-player performances vs a more overall balanced team dynamic.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
Python, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, seaborn
